# LEDFlasher

This code controls an LED Flasher circuit wired on a breadboard. The LEDs are controlled by the PIC microcontroller. The code for the microcontroller is 
written in the C programming language.

Inside the code contains an outline as to which pin is connected to each LED and various functions of different flashing patterns.
There are two buttons. When one is pressed the flasher completes one pattern and when the other is pressed the flasher completes a 
different pattern.
